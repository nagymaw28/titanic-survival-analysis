# Titanic Survival Analysis Project

This project explores the Titanic dataset to understand the relationships between passenger demographics and survival outcomes using Python.

## 🚀 Goals
- Analyze passenger survival rates across different demographic segments
- Gain hands-on experience with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn
- Demonstrate practical EDA and visualization skills for portfolio use

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
- Format: CSV

## 📊 Skills Demonstrated
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Visualization
- Data Storytelling

## 📌 Visualizations Include:
- Survival count
- Survival by gender
- Survival by passenger class

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Women and children had higher survival rates
- First-class passengers had better chances of survival
- Visual analysis reveals strong patterns by class and gender
